      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In a digital era marked by progressive technological advancement, the difficulty often lies in designing innovations that cater to the diverse needs of the global population. At the forefront of this dilemma is the senior demographic, a group characterized not just by health challenges, but also by vibrant dreams, ambitions and aspirations waiting to be realized. Despite their growing tech-savviness, the elderly often find their rich desires, such as the yearning for travel in their golden years, sidelined by mainstream solutions. In the wake of this problem, we present "Quebec Voyage
        Ensemble," an initiative that seeks to address the physical and mental wellbeing of the elderly in Quebec, especially in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic that reshaped the way they perceive healthcare, life goals, and social connections.
      </p>
      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px">Understanding the Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The World Health Organization’s data from 2018 throws light on a crucial aspect of modern living – while Canadians now enjoy a longer lifespan, their healthspan, the period devoid of chronic illness or degeneration, hasn't seen a comparable increase. This division highlights the need for innovative solutions that can extend the quality of life, not just its duration. While the market offers technologies aimed at enhancing the self-reliance, social engagement, and wellness of the elderly, ranging from health monitoring to medication reminders and fitness services, many fail to truly
        align with their deepest aspirations or provide a singular, enriching life experience tailored to senior users. In fact, elderly individuals, despite being in their old age and experiencing various physical and mental health challenges, yearn to connect, explore, realize their dreams and create lasting memories. The pandemic, with its social distancing measures, stay at home orders and particularly travel restrictions, only intensified these latent aspirations. "Quebec Voyage Ensemble" recognizes that physical activity, coupled with the fulfillment of life-long dreams, can play a
        pivotal role in enhancing both mental and physical wellness respectively. Our vision is not just a senior-friendly travel website, but a holistic platform that fosters community, exploration, and personal growth for Quebec's elderly population.
      </p>
      <h2 style="margin-top: 40px">Solution</h2>
      <p>We present a sophisticated travel and tourism platform tailored for senior users, enabling them to embark on group journeys across the globe. “Quebec Voyage Ensemble”, short QVA, caters to the deeply-seated aspirations many hold from their busier adult years, those dreams and experiences left unfulfilled due to life's demands. The COVID-19 pandemic, with its numerous restrictions, further heightened this yearning for travel among the elderly.</p>
      <p>With a UI/UX design tailored for seniors, our platform offers diverse travel packages, from adventurous excursions to historical explorations and tranquil retreats, ensuring there's something for every personality. Recognizing the varied physical capacities of older adults, trips are also categorized based on the level of activity involved, accommodating those who may have mobility constraints.</p>
      <p>To ensure the well-being of our senior travelers, we'll employ nurses and caregivers, funded by the Quebec government, to accompany groups. These healthcare professionals will oversee medication schedules, provide emotional and mobility support, offer assistance in navigation and local services, provide essential medical care in emergency situations, and perform many other duties to support and assist elderly travelers. This ensures that not just the physical safety but also the health of our travelers in times of potential health threats like COVID-19.</p>
      <p>Pre-trip social events will be organized, giving participants the chance to socialize and strengthen bonds, fostering a more compatible travel experience. We believe our platform will significantly contribute to the well-being of seniors, granting them the chance to realize long-held travel dreams, maintain being physically active, and form meaningful connections, all of which are crucial to their overall wellness.</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 60px; margin-bottom: 30px">Surveys</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 50px">
        Our research of the current market provided us profound insights into the problem at hand. However, in order to better understand our user needs, preferences, motivation and pain points, we formulated 5 key interview questions to ask a sample population of 40 seniors aged over 60 and above. We conducted in-person interviews in a senior retirement home, and using the collected data, plugged it into Excel in order to generate pie charts and graphs. These answers and data collected that would inform our website design, and served as further evidence to support our research
      </p>
      <!-- Question 1 -->
      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px">Question 1: "Would you be interested in participating in a travel group with individuals around your age?"</h4>
      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 40px">This question is to filter out the participants that are not interested in using our application.</h6>
      <img class="enlargeable-image" style="width: 600px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 25px" src="assets/interest-in-going-on-trip.png" alt="graph for interest in going on a trip" />
      <p>The people who voted no are people who will not be using our product, hence their input won't contribute to our application since they are not potential users.</p>
      <h4 style="color: #245c8d; margin-bottom: 50px">The following questions were conducted with the 29 people that voted yes (the 72%).</h4>
      <!-- Question 2 -->
      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px">Question 2: "What are your preffered vacation types?"</h4>
      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 40px">This is an open ended question which was grouped into categories in a chart. Each answer the person gave was considered in the chart</h6>
      <img class="enlargeable-image" style="width: 600px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 25px" src="assets/Preferred-vacation-type.png" alt="preffered vacation type graph" />
      <p style="margin-bottom: 50px">Through these answers, we were able to deduct everyone's responses' into 4 different categories. Most people wanted either a vacation to enjoy the beauty and the culture of other countries or simply a relaxing vaction, some of the people wanted some adventurous activities such as hiking and parachuting and the rest were mostly the elders with wheel chairs that wanted to go on a getaway as long as someone was there to assist them along the way for their needs.</p>

      <!-- Question 3 -->
      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px">Question 3: "How important is access to healthcare important for you during the trip?"</h4>
      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 40px">This question was asked in the format of a likert-scale and users had to answer from either one of 5 choices.</h6>
      <img class="enlargeable-image" style="width: 600px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 25px" src="assets/healthcare-need.png" alt="healthcare importance graph" />
      <p style="margin-bottom: 50px">
        Out of 29 individuals surveyed regarding the importance of healthcare during their trip, 8 deemed it to be of little to no significance. This response suggests that they perceive themselves to be in good health and may not require medical attention throughout their journey. Conversely, a majority of the participants rated healthcare as slightly or moderately important, indicating a general state of well-being, though they acknowledge the potential need for medical support. Those who categorized healthcare as important or very important are potentially dealing with serious underlying
        health conditions, underscoring the necessity for healthcare professionals to be readily available to assist during the trip.
      </p>

      <!-- Question 4 -->
      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px">Question 4: "Have you ever found the process of planning and booking a trip to be challenging?"</h4>
      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 40px">This question is an open ended question, we registered the responses of the people who have found it challenging to book a trip into categories</h6>

        <h5 style="color: #2c3e50">Group 1: Technology Challenges</h5>
        <p>1. "I'm not very comfortable using computers, and sometimes the websites are just too confusing."</p>
        <p>2. "Booking online can be tricky. I am never sure if I did everything right until I get a confirmation, and sometimes even that is confusing."</p>
        <p>3. "I find it difficult to navigate through multiple websites to compare prices and find the best deal."</p>
      </div>

      <div style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        <h5 style="color: #2c3e50">Group 2: Information Overload</h5>
        <p>1. "There’s just too much information out there. I don’t know where to start or who to trust."</p>
        <p>2. "Every site has so many options; it's overwhelming. I just need something simple and straightforward."</p>
        <p>3. "Sometimes there are too many choices for flights and hotels, and it’s hard to know what’s the best."</p>
      </div>

      <div style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        <h5 style="color: #2c3e50">Group 3: Accessibility and Usability</h5>
        <p>1. "The text on the websites is so small, and it’s hard for me to read without straining my eyes."</p>
        <p>2. "I find that not all websites are senior-friendly. I need larger fonts and a more straightforward layout."</p>
        <p>3. "Some websites do not work well with my screen reader, making it impossible for me to use them."</p>

      </div>
      <h5 style="margin-bottom: 50px">Our key takeway from this was that it must be easier for older people to book their vacation by contacting someone for help instead of doing it by themselves online.</h5>

      <!-- Question 5 -->
      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px">Question 5: "Are you interested in meeting the people you are going to travel with?"</h4>
      <h6 style="margin-bottom: 40px">Responses are recorded response in form of a likert scale users had to choose from the 5 following choices.</h6>
      <img class="enlargeable-image" style="width: 600px; cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 25px" src="assets/pre-trip-meetup.png" alt="pre-meet importance graph" />
      <p style="margin-bottom: 50px">To substantiate our hypothesis that potential travelers would prefer to familiarize themselves with their fellow journeyers to enhance their comfort levels, we posed a pertinent query.

      <p>
        After completing the app's functional design, we assembled an inspiration board to delve into different visual aesthetics. Making sure our platform embodies the theme of travel, the color palettes researched were dominated by soft blues, embodying trust and tranquility, warm golds reminiscent of the golden years, and gentle greens that hint at nature. In typography, elegant serif fonts that echo tradition and reliability were looked at. Simultaneously, we required clean, sans-serif fonts in order to prioritize user-friendliness for seniors. The imagery section is abundant with photos
        of breathtaking global destinations, and landscapes, since we want to provide our users a sense of nostalgia. We desired a user interface designed with large, easily clickable buttons, zoom features represented by magnifying glass icons, and accessibility symbols, to ensure the website is seamless and easily accessible to seniors. Overall, our aim was to create a sense of calm and serenity for our elderly users when they visit the website, ensuring they feel at ease and not overwhelmed.

      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 50px">Color Palette</h2>
      <p>
        After doing some research on various colors, the shades chosen for Quebec Voyage Ensemble will resonate with the elderly by providing a warm, welcoming, and user-centric interface that mirrors the essence of travel and tourism. The initial palette showcased nine soft, inviting, and easy on the eyes shades of pastel blues, greens, and beiges, with names like Mossy Path (#B1D9A9) and Calm Horizon (#92BAE0). These hues are gentle on the eyes, reducing strain, which is particularly crucial for older users, who may have vision issues or sensitivity to bright colors. The serene blues and
        greens can evoke feelings of peace, tranquility and nature, which can be appealing and inviting for seniors seeking peaceful travel experiences. Meanwhile, the beige tones, reminiscent of warm sand beaches and vintage maps, may invoke a sense of nostalgia.
